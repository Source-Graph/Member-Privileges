# Member-Privileges
Feature: on GitHub

'''Introducing new organization member privileges
We’ve made it even easier for you to collaborate, share code, and communicate with the people you work with. Let us show you what’s new.

Mention teams
Use team @mentions (ex. @github/design for the entire team) in any comment, issue, or pull request.

Create repositories
Feel free to create repositories and give access to the collaborators and teams you need to work with.

Build your teams
Members can create their own teams and invite other members. You can also request to join any team.'''
